2 Tier Architecture : means 2 layer (First layer is Client layer and the second layer is database)
it is also called client server architecture.

3 Tier Architecture: means 3 layers (
    First layer is Client Layer (API layer or interface layer)
    Second layer is Application layer
    Third layer is database server layer 
) 
We write query in client / API interface then it will be processed in server then return the 
expected output.

in 2 tier architecture the the query was processing inside database server,
but in 3 tier architecture the query will be processing inside Application / business layer.
All the code will be converted to the application layer / business layer and send it to the database layer.
But in 2 tire , the code was processing and converting to machine language first inside database server layer
which cause a slow performance and scalability is not maintained. Secondly security issue is concerned in 2 layer
also.
