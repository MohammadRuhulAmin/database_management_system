Advantages of database management system over File System.

1.Before Database system, there was fileSystem.Actually file system is in operating system
and it cannot be shared to client system or server system. that is a big problem. In database system 
the tables are shared among server and client both. From a Server all the data can be accessed
from all over the world. That is why there is no boundaries.

2.Quick searching

3.In a big data specific small data can be gathered easily by writing query.

4.meta data is a data abut a data.The data which describe about a specific data.
Like the name of a file or size of a file or the location of a file etc.

5.data is independent.

6. Concurrency . Multiple person can access data by writing query at the same time.
in Concurrency dbms has the protocol to access data but file system doesnot have.

7.Security issue is very important.Role based access control is possible in Dbms .
Like some of the authorized data can be accessed by student. Faculty can be accessed 
some more data. lastly all the data can be accessed by the supreme authorty. that is possible in 
database management system. but not possible in File System.

8.Data redanduncy or data duplicaty . it can be reduced in DBMS. Like :
my name is ruhul amin. this line can be written multiple time in a file system. which is a type of
data repetation. Operating system does not check a sentence multiple time. but in database it can be reduced.
Operating system may check a file is created multiple time or not but it does not check a data is written multiple
time.
