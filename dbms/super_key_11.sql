summation of candidate keys is called super key 

Lets say a table has 5 columns . ContactNo,RegistrationNo,emailId,Age and dob 

All these are candidate keys in the table 
if i want to make a super key 

the super key will be 

superkey = ContactNo + emailId + RegistrationNo 

To make a super key there must be at least one Candidate key with another column name.
