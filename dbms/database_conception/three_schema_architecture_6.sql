Schema means stracture.
This three schema architecture was created in 1970 for 
data independence. In this model user cannot be able to know
where the location of a data.We are storing everything in Google Drive.
but we dont know where the location is.

in this architecture the data can be represented in 
External Schema. 
the relation among the schema is described in Conceptual schema.

in physical schema the location of the database, the size of the database ,
the meta data has been described inside physical schema.
it describe, where the data is physically present!

can deside the data should be stored in distributed database or in centralized database system.
